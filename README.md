My first introduction to vim/neovim. An apology is owed to my friend Ruski from college, I should've listened to you and tried this sooner... It's awesome.

## Project Introduction
This is my first stab at working within neovim. I took nearly all my inspiration from [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) and [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev) on Youtube. That being said though, they offer some great starting points for understanding what you can do with neovim and lua.

I recommend going through typecraft's [free course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn) on youtube that walks you through the setup. He is extremely articulate and dumbs things down enough even for Noobs like me to understand.
